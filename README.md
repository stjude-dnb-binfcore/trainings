# Trainings

The `Trainings` repository contains a variety of training courses aimed at empowering researchers in the field of Developmental Neurobiology to utilize standardized computational pipelines for genomics data analysis and visualization to make more robust discoveries in the context of pediatric cancer and other catastrophic diseases. The `Trainings` repository is an initiative of the [Bioinformatics Core at the Department of Developmental Neurobiology at the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital](https://www.stjude.org/research/departments/developmental-neurobiology/shared-resources/bioinformatic-core.html).
