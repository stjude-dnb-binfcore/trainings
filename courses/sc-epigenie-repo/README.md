# Single-cell ATAC-seq workflow (scEpiGenie) Workshop

The [Single-cell ATAC-seq workflow (scEpiGenie)](https://github.com/stjude-dnb-binfcore/trainings/tree/main/courses/sc-epigenie-repo/) workshop is an introduction to the upstream and downstream analyses modules for pre-processing and analyzing single-cell ATAC (scATAC-Seq) data from 10X Genomics sequencing technology supporting human and mouse genome cohorts. This workshop is an initiative of our team at the [Bioinformatics Core at the Department of Developmental Neurobiology at the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital](https://www.stjude.org/research/departments/developmental-neurobiology/shared-resources/bioinformatic-core.html).

In this workshop, we will discuss how to navigate the analysis modules and explore the tools, methods, and reports (including results and plots) generated by [scEpiGenie](https://github.com/stjude-dnb-binfcore/sc-epigenie), a powerful and dynamic pipeline developed by our team at the [DNB Bioinformatics Core](https://github.com/stjude-dnb-binfcore).



| Audience | Computational Skills | Prerequisites | Duration |
:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------|
| Biologists/Bioinformaticians | Beginner | None | 1 h|


## Learning Objectives

1. Overview of Tools and Methods in the `scEpiGenie` pipeline
2. Reviewing Results, Plots, and Reports


## Target Audience

The course is intended for wet lab biologists or bioinformaticians that are interested in exploring the capabilities of the `scEpiGenie` pipeline. 


> These materials were developed for a trainer-led workshop, but are also amenable to self-guided learning.
