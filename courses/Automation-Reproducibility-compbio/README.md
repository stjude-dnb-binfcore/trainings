# Automation and Reproducibility in Computational Biology

The Automation and Reproducibility in Computational Biology is a training series to empower researchers in the field of Developmental Neurobiology to utilize standardized computational pipelines for genomics data to make more robust discoveries in the context of cancer and other pediatric catastrophic diseases. The Automation and Reproducibility in Computational Biology course is an initiative of the [Bioinformatics Core at the Department of Neurobiology at the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital](https://www.stjude.org/research/departments/developmental-neurobiology/shared-resources/bioinformatic-core.html).


| Audience | Computational Skills | Prerequisites | Duration |
:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------|
| Biologists/Bioinformaticians | Beginner/Intermediate | Shell basics | schedule.md|


## Learning Objectives

1. Best practices
   - Reproducibility
   - Documentation & Usability
   - Automation for Scientists
   - Containers for Cancer Informatics
   - Demo
2. Tools and Resources - UPCOMING
   - Reproducibility and Open sources
   - Leadership in Computational Biology/ Cancer Informatics
   - Data management
   - Data visualization

## Target Audience
The course is intended for cancer informatics tool developers, particularly those creating tools as a part of the [Department of Neurobiology at the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital](https://www.stjude.org/research/departments/developmental-neurobiology.html).

> These materials were developed for a trainer-led workshop, but are also amenable to self-guided learning.

## Lessons
* [01-Best-practices](https://github.com/stjudeDNBBinfCore/Trainings/tree/main/courses/Automation-Reproducibility-compbio/lectures/)


## Description

This repository has teaching materials and lectures for the Automation and Reproducibility in Computational Biology course. 
The material is inspired by fellow researchers with the main sources to be from the [Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) Training Network (ITN)](https://www.itcrtraining.org/) and the [Data Lab Reproducibility Workshop](https://alexslemonade.github.io/reproducible-research/workshop-schedule.html).


> Pre-requisite: Introduction to Shell and GitHub

This workshop focuses on teaching computational skills to enable best and effective practices for reproducibility and code review in computational biology teams.

The material in this workshop will assume participants have some practical experience using `git` and `GitHub`. You may wish to review the git resources available in the repository to help you get started. 

Materials:
* `./resources`: how to create a GitHub account, personal token, download GitKraken and GitHub desktop applications, and integrate GitHub with Teams/Slack app.
* `./lectures`: slides covering each topic as stated in the `Learning Objectives` and `Lessons`.
