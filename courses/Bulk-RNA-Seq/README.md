# Intro to RNA-Seq (CAB Results) Workshop

The `Intro to RNA-Seq (CAB Results)` is an introduction to bulk RNA-Sequencing data. The course discusses applications and key steps for sequencing: library prep, sequencing technology, and data analysis. The focal point of the course are the CAB pre-processing and alignment pipeline along with how to read the reports generated by the CAB pipeline and expected QC metrics.
 
Please see the [CAB’s AutoMapper pipeline for generating alignment and expression quantification results (see Section E)](https://wiki.stjude.org/display/CAB/AutoMapper#AutoMapper-E.RNA-sequencing(RNA-seq)) for more information.

 
Moreover, you can explore the [R Shiny apps](http://ibex.stjude.org/) CAB makes available for RNA-Seq analysis.
