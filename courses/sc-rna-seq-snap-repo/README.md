# Single cell RNA Seq Snap workflow (ScRNASeqSnap) Workshop

The [Single cell RNA Seq Snap workflow (ScRNASeqSnap)](https://github.com/stjude-dnb-binfcore/trainings/tree/main/courses/sc-rna-seq-snap-repo/) workshop is an introduction to the upstream and downstream analyses modules for pre-processing and analyzing single cell and single nuclei RNA (sc/snRNA) data from 10X sequencing technology. This workshop is an initiative of our team at the [Bioinformatics Core at the Department of Developmental Neurobiology at the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital](https://www.stjude.org/research/departments/developmental-neurobiology/shared-resources/bioinformatic-core.html)

In this workshop, we will discuss how to navigate the analysis modules and explore the tools, methods, and reports (including results and plots) generated by the [ScRNASeqSnap](https://github.com/stjude-dnb-binfcore/sc-rna-seq-snap), a powerful and dynamic pipeline developed by our team at the [DNB Bioinformatics Core](https://github.com/stjude-dnb-binfcore).
