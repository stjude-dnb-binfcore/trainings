# Single cell RNA Seq Snap workflow (ScRNASeqSnap) Workshop

The [Single cell RNA Seq Snap workflow (ScRNASeqSnap)](https://github.com/stjude-dnb-binfcore/trainings/tree/main/courses/sc-rna-seq-snap-repo/) workshop is an introduction to the upstream and downstream analyses modules for pre-processing and analyzing single cell and single nuclei RNA (sc/snRNA) data from 10X sequencing technology. This workshop is an initiative of the [Bioinformatics Core at the Department of Developmental Neurobiology at the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital](https://www.stjude.org/research/departments/developmental-neurobiology/shared-resources/bioinformatic-core.html)

In this workshop, we will discuss tools, methods, and reports (including results and plots) generated by the [ScRNASeqSnap](https://github.com/stjude-dnb-binfcore/sc-rna-seq-snap), a powerful and dynamic pipeline developed by our team at the [Bioinformatics Core at the Department of Developmental Neurobiology at the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital](https://www.stjude.org/research/departments/developmental-neurobiology/shared-resources/bioinformatic-core.html).



| Audience | Computational Skills | Prerequisites | Duration |
:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------|
| Biologists/Bioinformaticians | Beginner/Intermediate | Shell basics | 1.5h|


## Learning Objectives

1. Overview of Tools and Methods in the Repo
2. Best Practices for automation and reproducibility: (a) documentation and usability, (b) automation, and (c) containers
3. Code review and testing methods
4. Reviewing Results, Plots, and Reports
5. Addressing Common Pitfalls and Q&A



## Target Audience
The course is intended for cancer informatics tool developers, particularly those creating tools as a part of the [Department of Neurobiology at the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital](https://www.stjude.org/research/departments/developmental-neurobiology.html), but also for wet lab biologists that are interested in exploring the capabilities of the `ScRNASeqSnap` pipeline.

> These materials were developed for a trainer-led workshop, but are also amenable to self-guided learning.

## Lessons 🚧 🚧 🚧
* [sc-rna-seq-snap-repo-2024-12](https://github.com/stjude-dnb-binfcore/trainings/tree/main/courses/sc-rna-seq-snap-repo/lectures/sc-rna-seq-snap-repo-2024-12.pdf)


## Access to the workshop recording 🚧 🚧 🚧

St. Jude employees can have access to the [recording from the workshop]().


> Pre-requisite: Introduction to Shell and GitHub

This workshop focuses on teaching how to navigate the analysis modules, discuss the methods utilized per module, and the reports/output files expected. We will also disucss best and effective practices for reproducibility and code review in computational biology teams that our team leveraged during the pipeline development process.

The material in this workshop will assume participants have some practical experience using `git` and `GitHub`. However, users with now computational skills or prior experience are welcome.

Materials: 🚧 🚧 🚧
* `./resources`: supplemental materials and learning resources 
* `./lectures`: slides covering the `Learning Objectives`.
