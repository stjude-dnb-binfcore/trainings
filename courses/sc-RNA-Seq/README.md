# Intro to sc/snRNA-seq and Advanced visualization with R Shiny Workshop

The `Intro to sc/snRNA-seq and Advanced visualization with R Shiny` provides an introduction to QC of raw sc/snRNA-seq data, QC of sc/snRNA-seq alignment data, and cell-leveling filtering of sc/snRNA-seq data. Additionally, this course demonstrates how R Shiny applications can be utilized to explore sc/snRNA-seq data and produce figures for sc/snRNA-seq analysis.
 
 
For the visualization portion of the workshop, we utilize the [Honnell et al., 2022](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-27924-y) cohort displayed in the [R Shiny app](https://vsx2-deletion.stjude.org/).
