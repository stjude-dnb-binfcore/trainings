# Pitfalls of sc/snRNA-seq Workshop

The Pitfalls of sc/snRNA-seq workshop provides an overview of some common pitfalls that can occur when doing single cell or single nuclei RNA-seq analysis. This workshop is an initiative of our team at the [Bioinformatics Core at the Department of Developmental Neurobiology at the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital](https://www.stjude.org/research/departments/developmental-neurobiology/shared-resources/bioinformatic-core.html)

This workshop will focus on potential mistakes and how to avoid them as well as steps you may need to fine tune when performing sc/snRNA-seq analysis with Seurat. In paricular, we will cover common analysis steps starting with cell-level QC and filtering through cell type annotation, including normalization, variable gene selection, scaling, dimensionality reduction, clustering, integration, and differential expression analysis.



| Audience | Computational Skills | Prerequisites | Duration |
:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------|
| Biologists/Bioinformaticians | Beginner | None | 1 h|


## Learning Objectives

1. Recognize areas where pitfalls may occur
2. Understand how to avoid and/or troubleshoot these pitfalls


## Target Audience

The course is intended for biologists and bioinformaticians that are interested in sc/snRNA-seq analysis and want to understand how to avoid common mistakes during analysis. 


> Although this course was developed for a trainer-led workshop, it can also be used for self-guided learning and as a reference for areas to explore when troubleshooting sc/snRNA-seq analysis.
