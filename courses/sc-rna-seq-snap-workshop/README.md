# scRNA-seq Snap seq pipeline: Hands-on workshop

A brief overview of single cell RNA-seq is followed by a guided, hands-on run of the [Single cell RNA Seq Snap workflow (ScRNASeqSnap)](https://github.com/stjude-dnb-binfcore/trainings/tree/main/courses/sc-rna-seq-snap-repo/). Using a small training dataset, the workflow is executed end-to-end: QC, alignment & quantification, integration, clustering, cell-type annotation, and reporting via RShinyâ€”all within a reproducible, containerized HPC environment. Upon completion, participants receive a project folder containing standard figures, reports, an RShiny app, and comprehensive Snap pipeline documentation for further exploration.

This workshop is an initiative of our team at the [Bioinformatics Core at the Department of Developmental Neurobiology at the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital](https://www.stjude.org/research/departments/developmental-neurobiology/shared-resources/bioinformatic-core.html)





| Audience | Computational Skills | Prerequisites | Duration |
:----------|:----------|:----------|:----------|
| Biologists/Bioinformaticians | Beginner | None | 1 h|


## Learning Objectives

1. Prepare the required inputs: a properly formatted `project_metadata.tsv` and `project_parameters.Config.yaml`.
2. Launch the container on the HPC and submit or monitor your jobs.
3. Run the ScRNASeqSnap modules sequentially.
4. Review the generated results, plots, and reports.


## Target Audience

The course is intended for wet lab biologists or bioinformaticians that are interested in exploring the capabilities of the `ScRNASeqSnap` pipeline. 


> These materials were developed for a trainer-led workshop, but are also amenable to self-guided learning.
